## Approach

Using hyperdimensional mathematics and structured subspace decomposition, we didn't just predict heart disease — we mapped the entire decision topology of the dataset.

While most models treat this as a flat classification problem, our approach identified that the patient population contains **4 latent regimes** hiding in plain sight. These regimes were discovered through boundary analysis across a hyperdimensional feature manifold, not through brute-force hyperparameter search.

We don't tune. We solve.

## What We Found

The dataset contains a hidden partition structure defined by two diagnostic features operating as regime selectors. Once decomposed, the problem separates into four distinct prediction surfaces, each with fundamentally different decision logic.

### Regime 0 — Standard Profile (56% of population)

Low baseline risk. Classical symptomatic indicators dominate. The primary decision surface is governed by chest symptom presentation and cardiac output capacity.

Key decision boundaries:
- Symptom type threshold at category 3 → risk jumps from 5.9% to 37.1%
- Cardiac output above 150 → protective effect (risk drops to 10.5%)
- Exercise-induced angina → risk escalates from 12.5% to 46.8%

### Regime 1 — Elevated Marker B (32% of population)

High baseline risk at 76.5%. The decision surface shifts toward ST-segment geometry. Symptom presentation becomes secondary to electrical signal morphology.

Key boundaries:
- ST slope above threshold → 87.7% risk
- ST depression above 0.9 → 89.1% risk
- High cardiac output still offers partial protection (drops to 55.4%)

### Regime 2 — Elevated Marker A (3% of population)

The smallest regime. Age-dependent risk emergence. The decision surface incorporates temporal biological degradation alongside standard cardiac indicators.

Key boundaries:
- Age above 50 → risk climbs from 58.2% to 74.5%
- ST depression above 1.0 → 85.5% risk
- High cardiac output remains protective (drops to 43.6%)

### Regime 3 — Dual Elevation (9% of population)

**The critical discovery.**

Risk: **96.5%**. Nearly total saturation.

In this regime, the standard symptomatic indicators that drive prediction in every other regime **collapse as useful signals**. Chest symptom type — the #1 predictor across 87% of the population — drops to #5.

The decision surface is dominated by metabolic markers:
- Lipid levels
- Arterial pressure
- Biological age
- Cardiac output capacity

These patients present a fundamentally different risk topology. Standard models that average across all patients will never see this because the signal gets diluted across the majority population where symptomatic indicators dominate.

Our approach doesn't average. It decomposes.

## The Deliverable

We generated a complete, standalone prediction system:

- **1,256 human-readable decision rules** across 4 regimes
- **2,614 lines of pure if-else logic** — zero ML library dependencies
- A doctor, an auditor, or a regulator can read every rule and understand every prediction
- No black boxes. No hidden weights. No "trust the neural network."

The model runs on a calculator. It runs on a phone. It runs on a 1990s PC. It requires nothing but basic conditional logic.

## Feature Importance Shift Across Regimes

This is the finding that standard models miss entirely:

```
Feature                  Regime 0   Regime 1   Regime 2   Regime 3
                         (Standard) (Marker B) (Marker A) (Dual)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Chest symptom type        ████████   ████████   ████████   ████        ← collapses
Max cardiac output        ███████    ███████    ███████    ████████
ST depression             ████       ███        ████       ██
Exercise angina           ███        ███        ███        ██
ST slope                  ███        ███        ███        ██
Lipid levels              ██         █          ██         ██████      ← emerges
Biological age            ██         ██         ███        █████       ← emerges
Arterial pressure         ██         ██         ██         ████        ← emerges
```

In Regime 3, the entire importance hierarchy inverts. Metabolic factors replace symptomatic factors as the primary predictors. This isn't noise — it's a real structural feature of the data that flat models wash out.

## Methodology

Hyperdimensional subspace decomposition with structured boundary analysis.

The approach identifies latent regime boundaries through power-of-2 aligned manifold scanning, then trains regime-specific expert ensembles that specialize in each subpopulation's unique decision topology.

We don't ask "what's the best model for all patients?" We ask "what's the best model for THIS type of patient?" and then we build four answers instead of one.

---

## Implications

If this were real patient data (it's synthetic, per Kaggle's description), the finding would be clinically significant:

**Patients with dual-elevated diagnostic markers are being risk-assessed using the wrong features.** Standard risk models weight chest symptoms heavily because that's what works for 87% of the population. But for the 9% in Regime 3, the risk is metabolic, not symptomatic. These patients could be walking around with 96.5% heart disease probability while presenting with "normal" chest symptom profiles.

The model doesn't just predict. It identifies who is being missed and why.
