# Hyperdimensional Subspace Decomposition — Heart Disease Prediction Unblackboxed

## Approach

Instead of treating this as a flat classification problem, I used hyperdimensional mathematics to decompose the patient population into 4 latent regimes hiding inside the data. Each regime has a fundamentally different risk profile and requires its own specialized prediction logic.

The result: **AUC-ROC 0.953** with every single prediction fully explainable through human-readable if/then rules. No black boxes.

## What I Found

The dataset contains a hidden 4-zone partition defined by two diagnostic features acting as regime selectors:

| Regime | Patients | Heart Disease Rate | Primary Drivers |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Standard | 352,546 (56%) | 17.0% | Chest pain type, Max HR |
| High Thallium | 200,294 (32%) | 76.5% | ST slope, ST depression |
| High Vessel | 19,740 (3%) | 70.2% | Age, ST depression |
| Metabolic | 57,420 (9%) | **96.5%** | Cholesterol, BP, Age |

## The Critical Finding

In the Metabolic regime (9% of patients), chest pain type — the #1 predictor for 87% of the population — drops to #5. The risk becomes metabolic: cholesterol, blood pressure, and age take over. Standard models that average across all patients wash this signal out entirely.

These patients have a 96.5% heart disease rate but present with a completely different risk topology than the majority population. A flat model will never see this.

## The Deliverable

- 1,256 human-readable decision rules across 4 regimes
- 2,614 lines of standalone if-else prediction code (zero ML dependencies)
- Full regime analysis with feature importance shifts
- A prediction system a doctor could actually read and audit

## Full Code & Analysis

Everything is open source — the full pipeline, the unblackboxed rules, the standalone prediction code, and the showdown against standard models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Nets, etc.):

The dataset contains a hidden 4-zone partition defined by two diagnostic features acting as regime selectors:

| Regime | Patients | Heart Disease Rate | Primary Drivers |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Standard | 352,546 (56%) | 17.0% | Chest pain type, Max HR |
| High Thallium | 200,294 (32%) | 76.5% | ST slope, ST depression |
| High Vessel | 19,740 (3%) | 70.2% | Age, ST depression |
| Metabolic | 57,420 (9%) | **96.5%** | Cholesterol, BP, Age |

## The Critical Finding

In the Metabolic regime (9% of patients), chest pain type — the #1 predictor for 87% of the population — drops to #5. The risk becomes metabolic: cholesterol, blood pressure, and age take over. Standard models that average across all patients wash this signal out entirely.

These patients have a 96.5% heart disease rate but present with a completely different risk topology than the majority population. A flat model will never see this.

## The Deliverable

- 1,256 human-readable decision rules across 4 regimes
- 2,614 lines of standalone if-else prediction code (zero ML dependencies)
- Full regime analysis with feature importance shifts
- A prediction system a doctor could actually read and audit

## Full Code & Analysis

Everything is open source — the full pipeline, the unblackboxed rules, the standalone prediction code, and the showdown against standard models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Nets, etc.):

We don't predict. We decompose.# Hyperdimensional Subspace Decomposition — Heart Disease Prediction Unblackboxed

## Approach

Instead of treating this as a flat classification problem, I used hyperdimensional mathematics to decompose the patient population into 4 latent regimes hiding inside the data. Each regime has a fundamentally different risk profile and requires its own specialized prediction logic.

The result: **AUC-ROC 0.953** with every single prediction fully explainable through human-readable if/then rules. No black boxes.
